### Guidelines:

   - Update the topic and materials at least 2 weeks prior to your presentation.
   - Start preparing your presentation at least 2 weeks in advance.
   - Target for a presentation no longer that 30 min.
   - Don't have more than 25 slides, this will allow you to elaborate and you won't need to rush.
   - Practice, practice, and practice....
   - Start giving the audience 10 min to go over your materials (either a paper, or slides)
   - Send them a quick survey with 2-3 multiple choice questions.
   - Their answers, which you will be able to see immediately should give you an idea of the understanding that your audience have about what you will be presenting.
   - While presenting, elaborate on each slide, don't just read what the slide says.
   - Consider doing, by ~ half of your presentation one question via survey. This will help people not get distracted and will
     make a pause on your presentation.
   - Be sure your presentation covers the following:
   	    - Background and significance: provide background on the topic and explains why the research that you are about to present is relevant.
   	    - Data and methods: explain what is essential, and avoid spending time explaining details.
   	    - Results: focus first on the main results. Offer remarks about these results.
   	               if pertinent, you can have a couple of slides on not-so-central results that may be interesting or may offer insight.
   	    - Conclusions or, if you are presenting a proposal pose questions that you want the audience to discuss.
